# Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Seattle Airbnb Data

#### Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

#### Content
The following Airbnb data is included in this Seattle dataset:
- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

#### Inspiration for questions
- Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
  - What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
- Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
